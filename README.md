# [vRP] custom_teo-tokens

Custom Tokens System vRP by MyNameIsTeo__
This script is a kind of money system that allows you to add/remove tokens from players via commands or events.

### Commands:

- To add Tokens to a Player:
`/addtokens <id> <amount>`
- To remove Tokens from a Player:
`/removetokens <id> <amount>`
- To see how many Tokens a Player has:
`/gettokens <id>`

### Attention:

To use the commands to add/remove Tokens you need the ace permission. It can be set in the server.cfg with these strings:

`
    add_ace group.admin command allow
    add_ace group.admin command.quit deny
    add_principal identifier.steam:changeme group.admin 
`
You have to modify the changeme with your steam hex!

### Events:

- To add Tokens to a Player:
`TriggerServerEvent("custom_teo-tokens:AddTokensEvent", amount)`
- To remove Tokens from a Player:
`TriggerServerEvent("custom_teo-tokens:RemoveTokensEvent", amount)`
